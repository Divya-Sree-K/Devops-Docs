  AWS --> EKS
  Azure --> AKS
  GCP  --> GKE
  Oracle --> OKE

Kubernetes Objects --> Resources that are created in the kubernetes cluster
1. Pods --> Encapsulation (wrapper) around a container --> To deploy microservices
2. Replica Set --> To maintain a stable number of replica pods
3. Deployment --> to deploy the replicaset / maintain the history of all the deployments / rollback
4. Services --> To expose the pods --> NodePort (expose front-end pods), ClusterIP (communication between FP and BP), LoadBalancer
